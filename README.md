## 🧩 About Me

I like to think I'm special — and lately, I’ve come to believe that others should see themselves that way too. Not because I say so, but because it's true.

What makes me different? I have a relentless will — when I set my sights on something, I don't back down. I'm driven by purpose, fueled by a deep hunger to build, improve, and achieve. That's one of my defining traits.

I believe this is one of my defining qualities, I am also a pretty upbeat, with a no regret policy, overall mostly chill guy. At the end of the day, it all comes down to passion and the desire to grow. I believe I have what it takes — the question is: are you open to giving me the chance to show you?

- 🔭 Currently working on: AI Smart Assistants and Data Privacy with LLMs
- 🌱 Exploring: Edge AI, and Scalable Microservices  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe building is the new future, we are moving from consumerism to deployerism 🚀

#### 👨‍💻 The Standard Bit

I'm Naghul Pranav A S, a Computer Science Engineering graduate from NIT Puducherry.

With extensive experience across Full Stack Development, Software Testing, and Deep Learning, I bring a versatile toolkit to the table — ideal for solving real-world problems in a fresher-level engineering role.

Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. Scroll down to explore my work, projects, and achievements.
